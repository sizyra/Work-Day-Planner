# Work Day Planner

# Desc:
This planner will allow the user to enter events into their workday (9 AM to 5 PM) and it will track both the date and time to show the user when events are past, current, or upcoming.

The user may type an event or series of events into an hour block, then click the save button to save the text content to local storage. The content will remain even if the user refreshes or closes the window, and can be cleared if the user empties the text area and saves again.

# Progress:
Workday 1:
    Set up basic formatting of day planner, including 8 rows with a time, event space, and save icon.

Workday 2: 
    Created js/jQuery code to display current date/time and to alter hour block color based on present time (gray for past, red for present, green for future).

    Established start of code to save typed items to local storage in appropriate hourblock, but am struggling to refine this.

    Refined local storage code, which now works.
